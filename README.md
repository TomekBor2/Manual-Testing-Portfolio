# Manual-Testing-Portfolio

## About me

My name is Tomasz. I graduated from AGH UST. I am master in the field of renewable energy sources.
During my professional work so far, I have gained experience in many
areas of the energy industry. I dealt with both customer service and
tendering. I am familiar with energy audits, projects of photovoltaic power
plants or reports on thermal imaging studies and building air tightness
tests. I have also prepared some marketing articles about prevention of
heat loss in buildings.
Finally I've decided to change my profession and move to the IT industry.
I acquired my experience in mobile apps and web testing involving UI, logic, API, Bluetooth connection and bussiness processes low-code automation fields.
I also attended postgraduate studies of web apps development.
My goal is to develop knowledge in practice and gain skills on tests automation.

## Experience

Since October 2022 I work as a manual tester of mobile applications. During this time I was involved in one internal and two commercial projects.
My task was complex verification of applications working with IoT devices for medical purposes. Testing included UI, logic as well as backend issues.
The work was performed in agile methodology. Daily communication with the customer was conducted in English.
